  question: "Tell me about yourself.",
  response: "I graduated from Texas A&M University in 2015 with a degree in political science and a minor in business administration. As a student, I served as communications executive vice president and eventually chief of staff for the student government association. I interned with a company called Gov Whiz during my last semester and discovered a passion for UX/UI. Upon graduating, I was brought on full time by a partner company called Arena Edge, where I was a product manager for several years. During this time, I began learning the fundamentals of frontend development as a hobby. Iâ€™m currently seeking a product development position with a focus on UX and frontend development."
 },
 {
  value: "faq-2",
  question: "What is your greatest strength?",
  response: "Empathy and understanding where people come from. I'm a strong user advocate and believe that if a customer is unable to use a certain technology, it's not because the user is incompentent but rather because the technology hasn't been made easy enough for them to use."
 },
 {
  value: "faq-3",
  question: "What is your greatest weakness?",
  response: "I sometimes have a hard time understanding abstract concepts. I am, however, good at recognizing patterns so to compensate, I apply what I know about patterns to a given concept and the concept becomes less abstract."
 },
 {
  value: "faq-4",
  question: "Why should I hire you?",
  response: "I'm a utility player that can gracefully wear several different hats, I'm personable, and I work well with other people. I have a broad range of experience, a positive attitude, and an eagerness to learn and be utilized."
 },
 {
  value: "faq-5",
  question: "Tell me about a time you were successful on a team.",
  response: "I was a campaign manager for a student body president election and our campaign won with over 60% of the vote."
 },
 {
  value: "faq-6",
  question: "What do you like to do outside of work?",
  response: "I enjoy creating mini React and NextJS applications as side projects, playing dominoes, politics, spending time with friends and family, and taking my dog to the park."
 },
 {
  value: "faq-7",
  question: "Describe your most challenging project.",
  response: "I had to create a user guide from scratch that included detailed descriptions of each feature of the platform, step-by-step instructions on how to use each feature, table of contents, tech specs, glossary, and supporting graphics/imagery of the platform. It ended up being 170+ pages long."
 },
 {
  value: "faq-8",
  question: "How did you go from politics to tech?",
  response: "I thought I wanted to be a lawyer but discovered a passion for UI/UX while I was interning with a startup company during my last semester of school. I was hired as a channel manager for a partner company and eventually promoted to product manager, where I had the opportunity to work with our remote developers on a daily basis. I began learning frontend develoment as a way to supplement my knowledge of how web technologies work and more effectively communicate with our developers."
